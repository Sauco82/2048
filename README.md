caveats

performance n-1!
decoupling logic and animation
do not limit possible animations
trying to build something that can be easily extended without rewriting the logic (reason for the extra cell array)
making certain everything I thought works with a plain algorithm and tests
redux just because I have experience with it, regardless the state framework I would have introduced a reducer and inmutable logic
design secondary
css secondary
create-react-app left almost as found, didn't have time to clean too much or to get serious about file architecture
wanting to avoid the issues of the version found online relying on timeouts and DOM
I put low effort on the CSS I certainly canstructure it better and make it responsive enough so the app doesnt get cut in smaller screens

the cell array
the cell grid
