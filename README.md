caveats

performance n-1!
decoupling logic and animation
do not limit possible animations
trying to build something that can be easily extended without rewriting the logic (reason for the extra cell array)
making certain everything I thought works with a plain algorithm and tests
redux just because I have experience with it, regardless the state framework I would have introduced a reducer and inmutable logic
design secondary
css secondary
next + redux create-next-app left almost as found, didn't have time to clean too much
wanting to avoid the issues of the version found online relying on timeouts and DOM

the cell array
the cell grid
